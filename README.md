# Jordan DuBose's JavaScript Quiz

This quiz was created to test my peers on their JavaScript knowledge! The quiz covers the basic fundamentals of JavaScript and saves high scores to local storage for comparison.

## Motivation

* This quiz is a great way to test the knowledge of myself and my peers on the basics of JavaScript, in an enjoyable and unique manner. 

## Lessons Learned

* How to manipulate divs to show and hide. 
* How to code the option to save to local storage.
* How to create a timer that has functionality.
* How to use arrays and functions to create an interactive quiz.
  
## Challenges

* Manipulating the elements with show/hide functionality was very challenging.
* Setting up the array of questions and answers proved to be more difficult than originally planned.

Lastly, this project stands out due to the unique nature of the quiz flow and the linking to a highscores page that accesses local storage.

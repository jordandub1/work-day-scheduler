# Jordan's Work Day Scheduler

This application was created to track (and save locally) work day events from 9:00am to 5:00pm in hourly timeblocks. The scheduler also tracks the time during the day for the user to easily see what events have passed, are happening currently, or take place in the future. 

## Motivation

* I created this scheduler to easily track my day-to-day agenda including meetings, appointments, class times, and work due dates. As a full-time employee, student, and dog parent, it is difficult to keep track of all of my events across my work schedule, class schedule, and personal time. This application gives me the opportunity to track all of my different appointments without keeping them in separate apps. 

## Lessons Learned

* How to display the current date/time using moment JS. 
* How to tie the application with the current time to correctly display which events are in the past, present, and future. 
  
## Challenges

* The most challenging aspect of this application was using a conditional statement with the current time (moment JS) to correctly display for the end user which events are in the past, present, or future.
